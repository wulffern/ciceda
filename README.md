Getting started with SPICE and verilog can be a daunting task. Companies that
make integrated circuits spend millions on Electronic Design Assistance (EDA)
tools, and even then, the truth is, they are not great. 

So, expecting open source EDA tools to be a polished, easy to use, easy to learn
tools is too much to ask.

Luckliy, at the beginning of the integrated circuit journy we don't need the
full blown comercial tools. At the beginning, we need to understand the
principles of SPICE, Verilog, how to write the files, how to run the
simulations, and how to view the results.

The difference from open source EDA tools and the commercial ones is that it's
easier to make complex systems, and believe me, ICs are very complex.

For now though, let's focus on the transistors, resistor,  and the
building blocks for digital circuits, the digital gates.

# Tools
## Ngspice SPICE Simulator
ngspice is the open source spice simulator for electric and electronic circuits.
See more at http://ngspice.sourceforge.net

## Icarus Verilog Simulator
Icarus Verilog is a Verilog simulation and synthesis tool. It operates as a
compiler, compiling source code written in Verilog (IEEE-1364) into some target
format. For batch simulation, the compiler can generate an intermediate form
called vvp assembly. This intermediate form is executed by the ``vvp'' command.
For synthesis, the compiler generates netlists in the desired format.

## GTKWave
GTKWave is a fully featured GTK+ based wave viewer for Unix, Win32, and Mac OSX
which reads LXT, LXT2, VZT, FST, and GHW files as well as standard Verilog
VCD/EVCD files and allows their viewing. Documentation in pdf format can be
found http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/gtkwave.pdf.

# Support
I would try carsten@ntnu.no, however, I get about 100 emails per day, so my
response rate is not great.
